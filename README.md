# Made-To-Fail-fix-for-consumer-products
Hard-/software extension of life to end made-to-fail-manufactured-waste
Simple "downloadable soluions" for the most common consumer-goods early-fail 
cheap/free solutions using common materials or enablement of societal tech-literacy enlightenment .
OVERVIEW 6 general aspects engineered to make products fail:
Temperature, 2electronics, m3echanichal/design, s4oftware, 5fearmongering security/privacy.

1: Temperature: Heatsinks made substandard and near heatgenerating components

2: Electronics: Capacitors (electrolytic) and heat-deforming parts positioned where heat, moisture, vibration, mechanical stress cause annoyance hat leads to "warranty-violating anger".

3: Mechanical: unsecured lowvoltage wires/plugs/headers such as chargingports, headphonejacks, . No lubricationports (zerk-nipples, oil dipsticks). Parts impractical to clean, invisible moisture/muck-gathering points.

4: Software: Privacyviolations, dataarvesting, slowing down ahrdware, spreading to other hardwqare like a virus, persistence through renewals of hardware, hidden developer/manufacturer offgrid networks seperate from general comtech. Broadcast/response RF signalling serial operations

5: Security/Privacy: Fear as end-of-life for products. Engineered/overlooked exploits/vulnerabilities all publicy disclosed & elaborated- warranty expired - abused/exploited by manufacturer/dev since start.

6: Repairability



Solutions: 
! Temperature: Heatsinks, casing, airflow, placement. Reduction of materialhickness by automated process using whatever at hand: sand and a towel or lasercutter.
